Example Project for flick.


# flick

An extensive flick tool/widget for Flutter that allows very flexible flick management for your widgets. It is designed 
to work flawlessly with [snap](https://pub.dev/packages/snap) but it can be used as a standalone package too.

## Description
This is a very detailed flick tool/widget for Flutter that allows very flexible flick management for your widgets. Just wrap
the widget you want to flick with the FlickController widget, fill the parameters and this package will take care of everything else.


## Notes
I started using and learning Flutter only some weeks ago so this package might have some parts that don't make sense, 
that should be completely different, that could be much better, etc. Please let me know! Nicely! 

Any help, suggestion or criticism is appreciated! 

Cheers.
